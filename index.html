      <p>
        From the moment you walked into my life on that sunday, something shifted in the best way.
        You brought warmth where there was calm, laughter where there was silence,
        and meaning in ways I didn’t even know I was searching for.
        Being with you has shown me what it truly means to choose someone,
        not out of habit, not out of convenience, but with intention, faith, and a full heart. 
        Every conversation, every shared pain, 
        every quiet moment reminds me that loving you is not something I do by chance, but by choice.
        You inspire me to be better, to love deeper, and to stay true. 
        In you, I’ve found peace(small wahala), strength, 
        and a love that feels both gentle and powerful at the same time. 
        You are not just someone I care about, you are someone I value, respect, and choose daily.
        So today, with a heart that is certain and sincere, 
        I want to ask you something simple but meaningful.
        Not just for today, but as a celebration of us, our moments, 
        and everything that continues to grow between us.
      </p>
      <p>
        I choose you — faithfully, intentionally, and completely.
      </p>
